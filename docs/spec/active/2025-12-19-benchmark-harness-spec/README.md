# Benchmark Harness for Git-Native Semantic Memory Validation

## Project Overview

A comprehensive benchmark harness to validate the benefits of git-native semantic memory for AI coding agents. This system enables academic publication with reproducible results across five established benchmarks:

- **LongMemEval** (ICLR 2025) - Long-term memory evaluation
- **LoCoMo** (ACL 2024) - Long-context conversation memory
- **Context-Bench** (Letta, Oct 2025) - Agentic context engineering
- **Terminal-Bench 2.0** - Real-world coding task validation
- **MemoryAgentBench** (arXiv, July 2025) - Four competencies evaluation

## Current Status

🔴 **DRAFT** - Requirements elicitation in progress

- Target Repository: `zircote/memory-benchmark-harness`

## Success Criteria

1. Demonstrate measurable improvement over RAG baseline on memory abilities
2. All evaluations reproducible via Docker with single command
3. Results formatted for academic publication with statistical rigor
4. Phase-gated development enabling early validation
